Hi, I’m @patwashburn.
I’m interested in technical writing, cybersecurity governance, community-building, and internal communications.
I love books and have one in print: "Self-Care for Cats."
I’m learning threat hunting, product marketing, and how to build better Web sites with PHP, MySQL, and Python.
Contact me if you have freelance technical writing or small-scale Web projects.
How to reach me: pat@patwashburn.net, linkedin.com/in/patwashburn
